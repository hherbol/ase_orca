# ASE Orca

This is currently a rudimentary patch to the Atomic Simulation Enviroment (ASE) to allow for the use of Orca simulations.  Simply copy these files into their respective folders and you should be all set to go.  The examples folder shows example code, and the xyz folder has example xyz files needed for these codes.
